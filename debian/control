Description: nsswitch configuration for Debathena
 This packages configures nsswitch to get passwd information from
 Athena Hesiod, using libnss-nonlocal, which prevents network users
 from authenticating to the same uid as a local user (and similarly
 for network groups).  It also configures libnss-afspag, which gives
 names to AFS pag gids.
